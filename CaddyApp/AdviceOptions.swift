This means the pin is in the front of the green.\n\n- If you go with the longer club option, you might give yourself a better chance of hitting the green. \n\n- Remember, getting on the green and putting as soon as possible is the goal.\n\n- If you go with the shorter club option, you might have a better chance of getting closer to the pin, provided you hit it perfectly. However, if you mishit it, you could leave yourself with more work to do to get onto the green."
    
    let whiteFlagApproach = "- There is a white flag on this approach. This means the pin is in the middle of the green, giving an us an easy club choice.\n\n- Just go with the club/swing that is closest to the distance to the pin (i.e. has the smallest gap).\n\n- This way, if you hit it a little shorter or a little longer than expected, you still have a good chance of hitting the green."

This means the pin is in the back of the green.\n\n- If you go with the shorter club option, you might give yourself a better chance of hitting the green. \n\n- Remember, getting on the green and putting as soon as possible is the goal.\n\n- If you go with the longer club option, you might have a better chance of getting closer to the pin, provided  you hit it perfectly.

    let sideHillDown = "- Since the ball is below your feet level, you want to aim to the left of the target. The ball will naturally fade to the right in the air.\n\n- Use one club length longer than you normally would.\n\n- Open up your stance a little. Ball should be a little further back in your stance (closer to your back foot).\n\n- Place your weight on your front leg/side."
